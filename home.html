    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Introduction to HTML</u></h1>
    
    <p><strong>HTML</strong>, or <u>HyperText Markup Language</u>, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It forms the <strong>backbone of all websites</strong> and is essential for displaying text, images, links, and other media on web pages. Developed in the early 1990s by <strong><em>Tim Berners-Lee</em></strong>, HTML has evolved significantly to support the diverse needs of modern web applications and responsive design.</p>

    <p>At its core, HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that uses a series of <em>elements represented by tags</em>, which act as instructions for the browser. Each element serves a specific purpose, from defining headings, paragraphs, and lists to structuring complex components like forms, tables, and navigation menus. HTML tags typically consist of an opening tag (e.g., <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) and a closing tag (e.g., <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>), with content placed in between. Some tags, like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> for images, are self-closing.</p>

    <p>One of HTML's most powerful features is its ability to <strong><u>link documents and pages together</u></strong>, a concept known as "<em>hypertext</em>." <u>Hyperlinks</u>, created with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, allow users to <strong>navigate seamlessly</strong> from one page to another, forming the interconnected web that defines the internet today. These links can lead to other sections within the same document, external websites, or even downloadable resources, creating a flexible user experience.</p>

    <p>HTML is also designed to be <strong>extensible and interoperable</strong>, meaning it can work alongside other technologies like <u>CSS</u> (Cascading Style Sheets) and <u>JavaScript</u>. While HTML structures the content, CSS handles <em>presentation</em>, such as <strong>colors, fonts, and layout</strong>, allowing web developers to separate design from content. JavaScript adds <strong>interactivity</strong>, enabling dynamic features like animations, form validation, and responsive elements, transforming a static HTML page into an interactive application.</p>

    <p>Over time, HTML has gone through multiple versions, with <strong>HTML5</strong> being the latest major release. HTML5 introduced many new features, such as <em>native support for audio and video playback</em>, semantic elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and new form controls that simplify input handling. These enhancements make it easier to create <strong>rich, accessible web applications</strong> without relying on external plugins.</p>

    <p>In addition to new functionality, HTML5 emphasizes the importance of <strong>semantic markup</strong>. <u>Semantic HTML tags</u> provide meaning to the content beyond visual styling, making the structure more understandable for <em>search engines</em> and <strong>assistive technologies</strong>. For example, using <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> to define navigation or <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to group related content helps improve <strong>accessibility</strong> and <u>SEO</u> (Search Engine Optimization), as these tags convey the purpose of each content block to both users and search engines.</p>

    <p>Overall, HTML remains a foundational technology in web development, shaping how we interact with online content. From <strong>simple web pages</strong> to <em>complex applications</em>, understanding HTML is essential for anyone looking to build, design, or enhance a web presence. Its simplicity, combined with the power of modern advancements, has ensured HTML's <u>relevance and adaptability</u> in a constantly evolving digital landscape.</p>
